## Introduction
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

I was been able to perform Descriptive Analysis and provide answers to  Danny's Analytical questions,Using the company's Data,The tool used for this project is POSTGRES-SQL,it's Helps me in Optimizing the use of SQL CLAUSES such as WHERE,LIMIT,ORDER BY,GROUP BY,JOINS,SUBQUERY,WINDOW's FUNCTION,CTE

## Problem statement

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program
